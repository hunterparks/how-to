            <p>
                Players choose 22 cards which they split into two "hands", exchange with others
                and choose one to play first (hand) and other to play later (foot). If 22 cards
                are chosen, they get 100 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use one more deck than the number of players.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Joker</td>
                    <td>50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>A & 2</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>K Q J 10 9 8</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>7 6 5 4 3</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Joker and 2 are <i>wild</i>.</p>
            <p>Black 3 acts as a discard, cannot be melded.</p>
            <p>Red 3 - go back 500 points if left with it.</p>
            <p>
                Must have three of one kind to lay them down unless using a wild card. There must
                be equal or more of the "real" card than the wild card.
            </p>
            <p>Seven cards is a "canasta" or "book".</p>
            <p>
                Game is four hands long. To lay down meld in each hand:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1st hand - 60 points
                </li>
                <li>
                    2nd hand - 90 points
                </li>
                <li>
                    3rd hand - 120 points
                </li>
                <li>
                    4th hand - 150 points
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Must use all cards from hand before using foot. You can have a discard or not.
                If you don't have a discard, you can pick up your foot and continue playing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Must have 2 black (using wild cards) and 1 red (no wild cards) canasta to go out.
            </p>
            <p>
                If four people are playing, two are partners. Must have three of each kind of
                canasta to go out. Only discussion can be to ask if it's okay to go out.
