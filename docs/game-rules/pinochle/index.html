            <p>10 is between A and K in value.</p>
            <p>You must go over played cards if you can.</p>
            <p>You don't have to go over if it's trumped.</p>
            <p>
                You must trump if you are out of the suit played. If you are out of
                trump, play anything.

                The bid is what you need to make combining your meld (points) and the
                countable cards in your tricks.
            </p>
            <p>All players must show their melds.</p>
            <p>Winner of the bid starts playing out.</p>
